#     Explain the difference between the = operator and the == operator in Python.

a = 5  # '=' is assigning variable a value
b = 5
print(a == b)  # returns bool - '==' checks if two variables are equal

#     What does the ** operator do in Python, and how is it used?

# '**' operator acts as a exponential power to a value

c = 5
print(c ** 2)  # returns 25

#     What does the ^ operator do in Python, and in what context is it commonly used?

# '^' operator performs a bitwise XOR operation on two numbers.
# It is commonly used in computer science to perform bitwise operations on integers.

d = 10
e = 5
print(d ^ e)  # returns 15 - 1111
